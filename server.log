nohup: ignoring input
(node:29264) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///data/data/com.termux/files/home/home-solana/CryptoConsultSolana/server.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /data/data/com.termux/files/home/home-solana/CryptoConsultSolana/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
