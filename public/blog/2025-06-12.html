  <h1>BTC Breaks $110K — Market Update for June 12, 2025</h1>

  <p><strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong> has smashed through the $110,000 resistance zone with strength, confirming a high-volume breakout that invalidates previous top signals and sets the tone for a renewed leg up in this bull cycle.</p>

  <h2>📈 Key Levels</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Breakout confirmed above $96,000 and $110,000</li>
    <li>📊 High ETF inflows continue (BTC and ETH)</li>
    <li>📉 No major bearish divergences on 1H/4H/1D</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔥 SOL/BTC Watch</h2>
  <p>Solana is holding strong relative to BTC. If SOL/BTC reclaims 0.0016556 BTC with momentum, expect Solana to surge back toward $200+ in tandem.</p>

  <h2>🧠 CrimznBot's Take</h2>
  <blockquote>
    The $110K reclaim invalidates short-term bearish theses. ETF demand, institutional bid pressure, and increasing M2 liquidity are pushing us into price discovery again. The next logical levels are $115K and $123K — don’t fade strength.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>🛠️ Macro Fuel</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>US M2 money supply quietly rising again 📈</li>
    <li>Rate cut expectations holding for July FOMC</li>
    <li>More institutions (including Trump-linked firms) adding BTC to strategic reserves</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚀 Outlook</h2>
  <p>Momentum is back in the bulls’ hands. As long as BTC holds above $108K-$110K on the 4H or daily close, dips are for buying. Watch dominance, ETH ETF flows, and SOL strength for rotation plays.</p>
